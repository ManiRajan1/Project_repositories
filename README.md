**Welcome to my page!** 

## üßë‚Äçüíª About This Repository

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a software enthusiast focused on **Embedded Systems**, with a passion for optimizing development and testing workflows.

My work emphasizes:

- **Automation**
- **Toolchain Integration**
- **Compliance with standards** such as **ASPICE**, **ISO 26262**, and **DO-178B**

## Projects Overview
This repository is a growing collection of **tools and mini-projects** created to address real-world engineering problems across the embedded software lifecycle.

---
### Automated Project Compliance and Report Generation Handlers

+ A set of modular Python libraries designed to interact efficiently with **JIRA, Confluence, and GitLab APIs**.
+ Engineered for **performance and resource efficiency** by reducing redundant API calls and optimizing data access patterns.
+ Supports automated test result reporting in formats compliant with **DO-178B and ASPICE**, making it suitable for integration into CI/CD pipelines or documentation workflows.

---
### XIL testing using Simulated Network

+ A **lightweight Docker-based/RTOS simulator-based** setup simulating a CAN bus network using the virtual vcan0 interface.
+ Includes **services to send, receive, and log CAN messages**, ideal for early-stage HIL/SIL testing or validating CAN communication logic.
+ Easily extendable to interface with physical CAN devices connected to the host (e.g., via SocketCAN-compatible USB adapters).
+ Useful for prototyping embedded applications without requiring dedicated hardware.

---
### Stacked Test Automation

+ The project aims to leverage Perl and Robot Framework in Multi-Layered QA
+ The project demonstrates how both frameworks can interoperate in a layered testing strategy
+ Perl for embedded/functional tests
+ Robot Framework for acceptance, UI, or remote CLI/API tests
+ Showcasing a hybrid automation solution suitable for automotive systems.
