**Welcome to my page!** 

## üßë‚Äçüíª About This Repository

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a software enthusiast focused on **Embedded Systems**, with a passion for optimizing development and testing workflows.

My work emphasizes:

- **Automation**
- **Toolchain Integration**
- **Compliance with standards** such as **ASPICE**, **ISO 26262**, and **DO-178B**

This repository is a growing collection of **tools and mini-projects** created to address real-world engineering problems across the embedded software lifecycle.

### Automated Project Compliance and Report Generation Handlers
---
+ A set of modular Python libraries designed to interact efficiently with **JIRA, Confluence, and GitLab APIs**.
+ Engineered for **performance and resource efficiency** by reducing redundant API calls and optimizing data access patterns.
+ Supports automated test result reporting in formats compliant with **DO-178B and ASPICE**, making it suitable for integration into CI/CD pipelines or documentation workflows.

## Projects Overview
---
### HIL testing using Simulated Network
---
+ A **lightweight Docker-based** setup simulating a CAN bus network using the virtual vcan0 interface.
+ Includes **services to send, receive, and log CAN messages**, ideal for early-stage HIL testing or validating CAN communication logic.
+ Easily extendable to interface with physical CAN devices connected to the host (e.g., via SocketCAN-compatible USB adapters).
+ Useful for prototyping embedded applications without requiring dedicated hardware.

### Minimal setup of Yocto Project 
---
***In construction***
A minimal setup of an Yocto project over Poky.
