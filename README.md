## Configuration Mangament by API handlers
The aim of this project is to provide a set of modular and reusable API handler libraries that enable seamless integration and management of projects running on popular CI/CD platforms.

These handlers are designed to interact with services like issue trackers (e.g., JIRA), documentation platforms (e.g., Confluence), and source control tools (e.g. GitLab), allowing for automated retrieval, processing, and analysis of project data.

In addition these API wrappers are created such that the API requests donot stress the infrastructure and aid to generate automated reports — such as test execution summaries, pipeline statuses, and release notes — to support continuous monitoring, traceability, and decision-making in DevOps workflows.

The code repository of interest can be viewed by [PM_Rest_API_handlers](https://github.com/ManiRajan1/Project_repositories/tree/PM_Rest_API_handler)
