## Project repository

**Welcome to my page, fellow engineers!** 

I'm a software enthusiast working on Embedded Systems, with a passion for solving real-world challenges in development and testing workflows. I specialize in streamlining development and testing workflows, ensuring compliance with industry standards like ASPICE, ISO 26262, and DO-178B.

This repository is a collection of tools and mini-projects that I've built over time, inspired by practical problems I’ve encountered in my work.

Each project is designed to assist with various aspects of embedded software — from development and testing to configuration and system management.

Explore the individual branches, each containing a focused solution. A brief description of each is provided below.

### PM_Rest_API_handlers
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+ A curated set of Python library modules for efficiently retrieving data from JIRA, Confluence, and GitLab APIs.
+ These libraries are designed with performance in mind — they minimize API calls and optimize data access, enabling faster, more resource-efficient integration into your automation or reporting pipelines.

### Docker_based_HIL_testing
----------------------------------------------------------------------
+ A minimal implementation of a CAN bus simulation environment using Docker containers that send, listen to, and log CAN messages over a virtual CAN interface (vcan0)
+ The provided docker-compose setup can be extended to interact with physical CAN-enabled devices connected to the host Linux system (e.g., via USB CAN adapters like SocketCAN-compatible interfaces), assuming the host exposes them to the containers.
+ Ideal for rapid testing of HIL setups, CAN message flow validation, and embedded system simulations without needing physical CAN hardware
