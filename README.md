## Project repository

======================================================================

Welcome fellow engineers to my page. I am a software enthusiasit working on Embedded systems. 
I created this project repo based on the problems I faced time to time in my work.

The projects created in this repository are oriented towards creating handy tools supporting in the development, testing, configuration and management of software. 
Refer to each of the branches which are breifly described below:

### Yocto Project 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

A brief setup of an Yocto project over Poky ***In construction***

### PM_Rest_API_handlers

----------------------------------------------------------------------

+ A list of library files that you can use to fetch data from JIRA, Confluence and Gitlab
+ These libraries are created to minimize number of API calls while fetching the data resourcefully


### Docker_based_HIL_testing

----------------------------------------------------------------------

+ A minimal implementation of a CAN bus simulation environment using Docker containers that send, listen to, and log CAN messages over a virtual CAN interface (vcan0)
+ The provided docker-compose setup can be extended to interact with physical CAN-enabled devices connected to the host Linux system (e.g., via USB CAN adapters like SocketCAN-compatible interfaces), assuming the host exposes them to the containers.
+ Ideal for rapid testing of HIL setups, CAN message flow validation, and embedded system simulations without needing physical CAN hardware
