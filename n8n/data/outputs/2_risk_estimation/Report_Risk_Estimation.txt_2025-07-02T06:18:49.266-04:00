1. HZ-01 | No braking when pedestrian suddenly crosses
   - **Rating**: S3-E3-C2
   - **ASIL**: D
   - **Rationale**: Failure to brake for a pedestrian can result in fatalities (S3), this scenario occurs often in urban environments (E3), and is difficult for drivers to control once collision is imminent (C2).

2. HZ-02 | Late braking when a vehicle cuts in abruptly
   - **Rating**: S2-E3-C2
   - **ASIL**: C
   - **Rationale**: Late braking can cause severe injury or crashes (S2), occurs with medium frequency on highways and urban roads (E3), and is difficult to control given short time to react (C2).

3. HZ-03 | Excessive braking triggered by sensor obstruction (e.g., dirt, snow)
   - **Rating**: S1-E2-C1
   - **ASIL**: B
   - **Rationale**: Excessive braking may cause light to moderate injuries (S1), happens with low frequency given environmental controls (E2), but average drivers can often regain control (C1).

4. HZ-04 | Unintended braking due to sensor disagreement (camera vs radar)
   - **Rating**: S1-E2-C1
   - **ASIL**: B
   - **Rationale**: Unintended braking causes minor injuries or hazards (S1), sensor discrepancies are infrequent (E2), and average drivers can usually control the vehicle (C1).

5. HZ-05 | No brake intervention during system overload or transition to manual control
   - **Rating**: S2-E1-C3
   - **ASIL**: C
   - **Rationale**: Failure to brake during system overload or manual handover may result in severe injury (S2), occurs very rarely (E1), and may be uncontrollable in complex situations (C3).

**Likely Root Causes:**

- Sensor obstruction by dirt, snow, or weather conditions
- Electrical interference causing sensor or ECU malfunction
- Sensor disagreement or data fusion errors between radar and cameras
- Software overload or timing errors in control algorithms
- Incorrect or delayed handover logic during transition between automated and manual control
