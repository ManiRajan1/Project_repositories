1. HZ-01 | No braking when required leading to collision  
 - **Rating**: S3-E3-C3  
 - **ASIL**: D  
 - **Rationale**: Failure to brake when necessary in urban/highway environments can lead to fatal collisions (S3), occurs with medium frequency due to sensor obstruction or interference (E3), and is largely uncontrollable by the driver due to automation expectations (C3).  

2. HZ-02 | Excessive or unintended braking causing loss of vehicle control or rear-end collision  
 - **Rating**: S2-E2-C2  
 - **ASIL**: C  
 - **Rationale**: Excessive braking risks severe injuries from loss of control or rear impacts (S2), low probability linked to software errors or sensor faults (E2), with drivers facing difficulties regaining control quickly (C2).  

3. HZ-03 | Late braking reducing effectiveness of collision avoidance  
 - **Rating**: S2-E3-C2  
 - **ASIL**: C  
 - **Rationale**: Delayed braking can cause severe injuries (S2), occurs at medium frequency due to processing delays or sensor data latency (E3), and is difficult for drivers to compensate (C2).  

4. HZ-04 | System failure during sensor disagreement causing incorrect brake commands  
 - **Rating**: S2-E2-C3  
 - **ASIL**: D  
 - **Rationale**: Conflicting sensor data may trigger hazardous braking or no braking with potential life-threatening consequences (S2), low probability but critical (E2), and generally uncontrollable by drivers (C3).  

5. HZ-05 | Failure to warn driver in critical situations resulting in delayed driver response  
 - **Rating**: S1-E3-C2  
 - **ASIL**: B  
 - **Rationale**: Missing warnings may cause light to moderate injuries due to delayed driver reaction (S1), medium scenario occurrence in complex situations (E3), and partial driver controllability (C2).
