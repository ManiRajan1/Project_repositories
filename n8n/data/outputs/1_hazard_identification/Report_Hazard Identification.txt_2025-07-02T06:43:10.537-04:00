Object detection (vehicles, pedestrians)\n2. Collision risk calculation\n3. Automatic brake application\n4. Driver warning (visual/auditory/haptic)\n5. System status monitoring\n\n## Interfaces\n- **Inputs**: Radar signals, camera images, vehicle speed, GPS\n- **Outputs**: Brake commands, warning signals, system status\n\n## Known Operational Scenarios\n1. Sudden pedestrian crossing\n2. Vehicle cutting in\n3. Stationary object detection\n4. Low visibility conditions\n5. Tunnel entry/exit\n\n## Potential Abnormal Conditions\n- Sensor obstruction (dirt, snow)\n- Electrical interference\n- Extreme weather\n- GPS signal loss\n- High glare situations\n\n# HAZOP Guidewords to Consider\n- No braking when required\n- Late braking\n- Excessive braking\n- Unintended braking\n- Incorrect braking force\n\n# Edge Cases for Analysis\n1. System behavior during sensor disagreement (camera vs radar)\n2. Response to non-standard objects (animals, debris)\n3. Behavior during system overload\n4. Transition between automated and manual control.\n\nOutput:\n1. 5 potential hazards\n2. Likely root causes\n3. ISO 26262 relevant clauses\n\n---\n\n1. Potential Hazards:\n\n1) No braking when required leading to collision\n2) Excessive or unintended braking causing loss of vehicle control or rear-end collision\n3) Late braking reducing effectiveness of collision avoidance\n4) System failure during sensor disagreement causing incorrect brake commands\n5) Failure to warn driver in critical situations resulting in delayed driver response\n\n2. Likely Root Causes:\n\n- Sensor obstruction (dirt, snow) causing inaccurate or no object detection\n- Electrical interference leading to corrupted sensor inputs or ECU malfunction\n- Software errors in risk calculation or brake command logic\n- Sensor data inconsistency between radar and camera leading to wrong decisions\n- GPS signal loss affecting vehicle positioning and decision-making\n- System overload reducing processing capability impacting timely decisions\n- Transition issues between automated and manual control causing command conflicts\n- Environmental conditions like low visibility or high glare affecting sensor effectiveness\n\n3. Relevant ISO 26262 Clauses:\n\n- Part 3: Concept phase (Hazard analysis and risk assessment, including HARA) - Clauses 7 and 8\n- Part 4: Product development at the system level (System design and safety requirements) - Clauses 6, 7\n- Part 5: Product development at the hardware level (Hardware design and integration) - Clauses 5, 7\n- Part 6: Product development at the software level (Software design, implementation and testing) - Clauses 6, 7, 8, 9\n- Part 7: Production, operation, service and decommissioning (Ensuring functional safety during vehicle operation) - Clauses 4, 5\n- Part 9: Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL)-oriented and safety-oriented analyses (including HAZOP) - Clauses 5, 6\n\nThese clauses guide the identification, analysis, and mitigation of hazards, ensuring the ADAS emergency braking system meets functional safety requirements."
