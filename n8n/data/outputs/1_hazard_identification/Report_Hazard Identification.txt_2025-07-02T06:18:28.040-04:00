Object detection (vehicles, pedestrians)\n2. Collision risk calculation\n3. Automatic brake application\n4. Driver warning (visual/auditory/haptic)\n5. System status monitoring\n\n## Interfaces\n- **Inputs**: Radar signals, camera images, vehicle speed, GPS\n- **Outputs**: Brake commands, warning signals, system status\n\n## Known Operational Scenarios\n1. Sudden pedestrian crossing\n2. Vehicle cutting in\n3. Stationary object detection\n4. Low visibility conditions\n5. Tunnel entry/exit\n\n## Potential Abnormal Conditions\n- Sensor obstruction (dirt, snow)\n- Electrical interference\n- Extreme weather\n- GPS signal loss\n- High glare situations\n\n# HAZOP Guidewords to Consider\n- No braking when required\n- Late braking\n- Excessive braking\n- Unintended braking\n- Incorrect braking force\n\n# Edge Cases for Analysis\n1. System behavior during sensor disagreement (camera vs radar)\n2. Response to non-standard objects (animals, debris)\n3. Behavior during system overload\n4. Transition between automated and manual control.\n\nOutput:\n1. 5 potential hazards\n2. Likely root causes\n3. ISO 26262 relevant clauses"
