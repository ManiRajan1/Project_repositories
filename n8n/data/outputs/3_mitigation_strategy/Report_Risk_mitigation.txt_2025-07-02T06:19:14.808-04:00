### HZ-01 | No braking when pedestrian suddenly crosses (ASIL D)
- **Technical Controls**:
  1. Dual redundant object detection sensors (radar + camera) with diverse measurement principles (ISO 26262-8-5.4.2)  
     - *Rationale*: Redundancy reduces single-point failures preventing braking.  
  2. Safety-critical ECU implementation with fault-tolerant architecture and hardware redundancy (ISO 26262-10-7)  
     - *Rationale*: Ensures continuous operation despite hardware faults.  
  3. SIL-4 compliant braking control software implementing continuous monitoring and plausibility checks (ISO 26262-9-7)  
     - *Rationale*: High integrity software mitigates logic errors causing no braking.  
  4. Real-time sensor health diagnostics to detect obstruction, degradation, and signal loss (ISO 26262-8-9)  
     - *Rationale*: Early detection enables fallback or warning to driver.  
- **Process Controls**:  
  - Perform 100% MC/DC coverage testing and exhaustive scenario simulations including pedestrian crossing cases (ISO 26262-7-9)  
    - *Validation Method*: Test and Analysis  
  - Develop comprehensive safety case documenting all mitigation and verification activities (ISO 26262-2-11)  
    - *Validation Method*: Review  
  - Establish maintenance protocols for sensor cleaning and calibration during vehicle service (ISO 26262-11-6)  
    - *Validation Method*: Procedure Review

### HZ-02 | Late braking when a vehicle cuts in abruptly (ASIL C)
- **Technical Controls**:
  1. Single safety mechanism with sensor fusion algorithm diversity to improve detection and timely response (ISO 26262-9-6)  
     - *Rationale*: Enhances detection accuracy reducing late braking occurrences.  
  2. SIL-3 compliant timing and deadline monitoring on collision risk calculation modules (ISO 26262-9-7)  
     - *Rationale*: Ensures deadlines for braking decision are met.  
  3. Driver warning system to alert early of high collision risk (visual, auditory, haptic) (ISO 26262-8-6)  
     - *Rationale*: Supplements automated braking response to reduce risk.  
- **Process Controls**:  
  - Conduct targeted fault injection testing focusing on sensor delay and fusion timing properties (ISO 26262-7-9)  
    - *Validation Method*: Test  
  - Document algorithm design and validation evidences in safety plan (ISO 26262-2-11)  
    - *Validation Method*: Review

### HZ-03 | Excessive braking triggered by sensor obstruction (e.g., dirt, snow) (ASIL B)
- **Technical Controls**:
  1. Diagnostic monitoring incorporating sensor self-test and obstruction detection algorithms (ISO 26262-8-9)  
     - *Rationale*: Prevents inappropriate braking commands by detecting sensor faults.  
  2. SIL-2 compliant software implementing braking force limits and plausibility checks (ISO 26262-9-7)  
     - *Rationale*: Reduces risk of excessive braking severity.  
- **Process Controls**:  
  - Define and execute regression tests for sensor fault scenarios and obstruction effects (ISO 26262-7-9)  
    - *Validation Method*: Test  
  - Create maintenance and user notification instructions for sensor cleaning (ISO 26262-11-6)  
    - *Validation Method*: Procedure Review

### HZ-04 | Unintended braking due to sensor disagreement (camera vs radar) (ASIL B)
- **Technical Controls**:
  1. Diagnostic algorithms detecting sensor disagreement with voting or arbitration logic (ISO 26262-8-9)  
     - *Rationale*: Mitigates risks from conflicting sensor inputs causing unintended braking.  
  2. SIL-2 software design with error detection, fault masking and graceful degradation strategies (ISO 26262-9-7)  
     - *Rationale*: Improves system robustness against inconsistent data.  
- **Process Controls**:  
  - Perform consistency checking via software-in-the-loop simulations for sensor disagreement cases (ISO 26262-7-9)  
    - *Validation Method*: Analysis  
  - Maintain documented rationale and validation reports related to sensor fusion mitigation (ISO 26262-2-11)  
    - *Validation Method*: Review

### HZ-05 | No brake intervention during system overload or transition to manual control (ASIL C)
- **Technical Controls**:
  1. Implementation of real-time load monitoring and fallback modes with safe degraded behavior (ISO 26262-8-9)  
     - *Rationale*: Detects overload conditions and triggers fallback braking control.  
  2. SIL-3 certified handover management software ensuring timely and guaranteed brake command submission (ISO 26262-9-7)  
     - *Rationale*: Ensures safe transitions between automated and manual control.  
- **Process Controls**:  
  - Conduct timing analysis and robustness tests on overload and handover scenarios (ISO 26262-7-9)  
    - *Validation Method*: Test and Analysis  
  - Prepare detailed transition management process documentation with verification evidence (ISO 26262-2-11)  
    - *Validation Method*: Review

**Traceability**: These mitigation strategies map directly to hazards HZ-01 through HZ-05 and their respective ASIL ratings as per ISO 26262 Clause 6. Technical controls address hardware and software system design (Clauses 8-10) while process controls ensure thorough verification and validation (Clause 7) and operation phase safety (Clause 11).
