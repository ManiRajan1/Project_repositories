### HZ-01 | No braking when required leading to collision (ASIL D)
- **Technical Controls**:
  1. Dual-redundant sensor systems (radar + camera) with cross-check and voting logic (ISO 26262-5-7)  
     - *Rationale*: Redundancy mitigates sensor obstruction and interference by providing diverse, independent detections.  
  2. SIL-4 rated fail-safe brake actuator hardware with independent control channels (ISO 26262-5-7)  
     - *Rationale*: Hardware fault tolerance ensures brake command execution despite ECU or sensor failures.  
  3. SIL-4 compliant software safety mechanisms including watchdog timers and plausibility checks (ISO 26262-6-6)  
     - *Rationale*: Detect and recover from software anomalies to avoid no braking scenarios.  
- **Process Controls**:  
  - Comprehensive HARA and safety case documentation demonstrating hazard mitigation (ISO 26262-3-7, ISO 26262-1-7)  
    - *Validation Method*: Safety review and audit  
  - 100% MC/DC coverage and fault injection testing for braking logic software (ISO 26262-6-9)  
    - *Validation Method*: Software testing and analysis  
  - Regular on-field diagnostic tests and OTA update protocols to maintain sensor and actuator integrity (ISO 26262-7-5)  
    - *Validation Method*: Field data monitoring and regression testing  

### HZ-02 | Excessive or unintended braking causing loss of vehicle control or rear-end collision (ASIL C)
- **Technical Controls**:
  1. Single safety mechanism with plausibility check algorithms to limit brake force magnitude (ISO 26262-6-6)  
     - *Rationale*: Prevents overly aggressive brake commands due to software or sensor faults.  
  2. SIL-3 software error detection and recovery including limit checks and fallback modes (ISO 26262-6-7)  
     - *Rationale*: Timely detection of calculation errors reduces unintended braking risks.  
- **Process Controls**:  
  - Verification of brake command logic through model-based design and formal methods (ISO 26262-6-9)  
    - *Validation Method*: Verification reports and formal proofs  
  - Rigorous review and traceability of safety requirements to braking system design (ISO 26262-4-6)  
    - *Validation Method*: Document and design audits  

### HZ-03 | Late braking reducing effectiveness of collision avoidance (ASIL C)
- **Technical Controls**:
  1. Timely sensor fusion algorithms monitored with latency detection and timeout triggers (ISO 26262-6-6)  
     - *Rationale*: Minimizes risk of stale or delayed data causing late brake commands.  
  2. SIL-3 hardware with real-time capable ECU to guarantee processing deadlines (ISO 26262-5-7)  
     - *Rationale*: Ensures computational resources meet timing constraints.  
- **Process Controls**:  
  - Performance testing including worst-case execution time (WCET) measurements (ISO 26262-6-9)  
    - *Validation Method*: Timing analysis and stress testing  
  - Periodic maintenance policies for sensor calibration and cleaning to prevent degraded input (ISO 26262-7-5)  
    - *Validation Method*: Maintenance logs and field inspections  

### HZ-04 | System failure during sensor disagreement causing incorrect brake commands (ASIL D)
- **Technical Controls**:
  1. Diversity architecture with independent radar and camera processing chains (ISO 26262-5-7)  
     - *Rationale*: Reduces risk of common cause failure by heterogeneous sensing and processing.  
  2. SIL-4 rated arbitration fail-safe logic that enters safe fallback state upon unresolved sensor conflicts (ISO 26262-6-6)  
     - *Rationale*: Prevents hazardous outputs from contradictory inputs.  
- **Process Controls**:  
  - Validation of sensor disagreement resolution algorithms with fault injection and simulation (ISO 26262-6-9)  
    - *Validation Method*: Simulation testing and fault injection reports  
  - Requirements traceability ensuring sensor fusion safety requirements completeness (ISO 26262-4-6)  
    - *Validation Method*: Requirements review and audit  

### HZ-05 | Failure to warn driver in critical situations resulting in delayed driver response (ASIL B)
- **Technical Controls**:
  1. Diagnostic monitoring of driver warning system (visual/auditory/haptic) with fallback alerts (ISO 26262-6-6)  
     - *Rationale*: Ensures warnings are initiated and alternate alerts activate on failure.  
  2. SIL-2 compliant software for warning timing and modality selection (ISO 26262-6-7)  
     - *Rationale*: Guarantees correct generation of warnings based on situation analysis.  
- **Process Controls**:  
  - Human factors validation including user acceptance testing of warning modalities (ISO 26262-7-4)  
    - *Validation Method*: User trials and ergonomic assessment  
  - Regular functional tests during maintenance cycles to verify warning system integrity (ISO 26262-7-5)  
    - *Validation Method*: Functional testing and diagnostic reports
