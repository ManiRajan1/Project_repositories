# System Description: ADAS Emergency Braking System

## System Overview
- **Purpose**: Automatic emergency braking for collision avoidance
- **Components**: Radar, cameras, ECU, brake actuators, driver warning system
- **Operating Conditions**: 
  - Speed range: 5-140 km/h
  - Environments: Urban, highway, tunnel, rain/snow conditions

## Key Functions
1. Object detection (vehicles, pedestrians)
2. Collision risk calculation
3. Automatic brake application
4. Driver warning (visual/auditory/haptic)
5. System status monitoring

## Interfaces
- **Inputs**: Radar signals, camera images, vehicle speed, GPS
- **Outputs**: Brake commands, warning signals, system status

## Known Operational Scenarios
1. Sudden pedestrian crossing
2. Vehicle cutting in
3. Stationary object detection
4. Low visibility conditions
5. Tunnel entry/exit

## Potential Abnormal Conditions
- Sensor obstruction (dirt, snow)
- Electrical interference
- Extreme weather
- GPS signal loss
- High glare situations

# HAZOP Guidewords to Consider
- No braking when required
- Late braking
- Excessive braking
- Unintended braking
- Incorrect braking force

# Edge Cases for Analysis
1. System behavior during sensor disagreement (camera vs radar)
2. Response to non-standard objects (animals, debris)
3. Behavior during system overload
4. Transition between automated and manual control
